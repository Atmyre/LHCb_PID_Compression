# LHCb_PID_Compression
A benchmark to the challenge of compressing an obscured dataset containing Particle Identification

The data can be found here: https://zenodo.org/record/1231531#.WyZSQFOFO3V

Download it and put it into a folder called 'Data' in this directory.

Installing FunctionScaler(https://github.com/weissercn/FunctionScaler/) as a dependency is required. This can be done using pip (pip install FunctionScaler). 
Other requirements: keras, sklearn, pandas, matplotlib, pickle

Run the following notebook in this order:
1. Prepare
2. Train
3. Analyse Output
4. Cross Check
5. ROOT compression
